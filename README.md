## Phoenix 1.7 LiveView Chat App with TailwindCSS from ProductiveProgrammer.com

This is the finished version of my phoenix 1.7 liveview chat app that I built during my project 1 walkthrough of the full version of my paid phoenix liveview course at https://ProductiveProgrammer.com

If you want to build other applications like this or see all of the snapshots of this code as I built it step by step then that is available exclusively in the full version of my course where you'll be able to access that. This repo is simply the finished version. Please note it only works with Phoenix 1.7 not prior versions of phoenix, and all of the installation, setup steps, and additional details are in my course at productiveprogrammer.com
