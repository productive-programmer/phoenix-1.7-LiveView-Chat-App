If you want to see all of the code in progression with snapshots of the code as I built it step by step then that is available exclusively in the full version of my course. This is simply the finished version. Please note it only works with Phoenix 1.7 not prior versions of phoenix, again additional details in my course if needed at productiveprogrammer.com
