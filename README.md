## Phoenix 1.7 LiveView Chat App with TailwindCSS from ProductiveProgrammer.com

This is the finished version of my phoenix 1.7 liveview chat app that I built during my project 1 walkthrough of the full version of my paid phoenix liveview course at https://ProductiveProgrammer.com

If you want to see all of the code progress with snapshots of the code as I built it in progression then that is available exclusively in when you take the full version of my course. This is simply the finished version and it only works with Phoenix 1.7 not prior versions of phoenix, again additional details in my course if needed at productiveprogrammer.com
